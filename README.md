# MPS Calculator

This project is a simple option for calculating the **Motivation Potential Score (MPS)** based on the **Job Characteristics Theory** by Hackman and Oldham (1975, 1980). The calculator takes user inputs for five key job characteristics and computes the MPS using the provided formula. Additionally, it provides a graphical representation of the score on a gradient bar.

## Features

- Calculates the **Motivation Potential Score (MPS)** using the formula:  
  **MPS = [(Skill Variety + Task Identity + Task Significance) / 3] × Autonomy × Feedback**
- Ensures user inputs are within the valid range (1–7).
- Displays the MPS value numerically and graphically on a gradient bar (red to green).
- Includes a clean, responsive design for usability.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for the structure of the application.
- **CSS** for styling, including the gradient bar and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript** for MPS calculation, input validation, and dynamic graphical updates.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mps-calculator.git
   ```
2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
3. Enter values between 1 and 7 for each of the five job characteristics:
    * Skill Variety
    * Task Identity
    * Task Significance
    * Autonomy
    * Feedback
4. Click the "Calculate MPS" button.
5. View the numerical result and the corresponding position on the gradient scale.

## Motivation
This project was created as part of my coursework at University of Applied Psychology.  
The goal was to provide a practical, interactive tool to demonstrate how the Job Characteristics Theory can be applied to evaluate the motivational potential of jobs.
